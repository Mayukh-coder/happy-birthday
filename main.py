Happy birthday, {t}. 
I would have made today a public holiday because you are a rare breed but letâ€™s leave that for another day. 
To my one and only, you deserve the blessings showered on you and many other benefits that God will unleash on you. 
Smile today and every other day of your life on earth.
From the one crazy friend named {f}. Wish you a happy Birthday again
